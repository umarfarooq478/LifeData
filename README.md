This project utilizes Google Apps Script to fetch event data from Google Calendar and automatically store it in Google Sheets. It then processes the data to generate insightful analytics and key productivity metrics, such as total hours spent, meeting trends, and time allocation per category. Users can visualize their productivity with charts and reports, helping them optimize their schedules and improve time management.
